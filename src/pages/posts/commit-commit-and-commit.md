Here is a summary of what I've done so far:

- moved alot of stuff (incluing the test post. you can find it [here](/posts/tests/1)).
- added and removed a banner.
- added a way to add custom class names in astro components (you thinking why didn't you do that from the start? more later).
- copied some code from a ProTailwind tip for tailwind container queries.
- best of all added thumbnails for blog posts!

Here is a summary of what I want to add:

- a navbar.
- better posts page.
- better home page (that won't come for awhile).

I would like to put this here because it's true:

> I love Astro and Tailwind ALOT.
