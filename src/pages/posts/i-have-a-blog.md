# Why?

---

I've been wanting to make a website using Astro for awhile now and I thought that a personal blog would be a good place to start. I might not actually write any posts but it's nice to know this is here if I want to use it.

# How?

---

So this website uses Astro, TailwindCSS, @tailwindcss/typography and it's deployed on Github Pages. I was trying the blog feature and was like:

> Where are all the styles that Github has?

So I went and googled (as a pro would ðŸ˜Ž) `tailwind markdown styles` scrolled down a bit and found that the offical plugin I have looked at quite a few times was just the thing I needed! So I installed it and quikly figure

One thing that took me awhile to figure out was what to do with the BaseLayout astro component. The home page of this website has overflow set to hidden and I needed it to be not to be hidden for the blog posts. I tried using `` <body class=`bg-almostwhite p-6 ${class}`> `` but for some reason astro rejected that and error with some like this: `expected '{' got '}'`. So in the end I just used a boolean ðŸ˜­.

# What next?

---

Personally I think that this site is quite ugly so it might need a UI update also the html is a bit messy. I also think I might add thumbnails to the posts.
